The syntax is as follows:

- All text is parsed as plain literal characters until a "^" is encountered.

- "^^" represents a single literal "^" character.

- Within any ^ sequence, even an escaped escape or quote, whitespace is
  optional in most places except between literals. Put another way, places
  where you might, in other languages, be used to putting a comma after a term
  or a required space or punctuation after a keyword, are required whitespace
  in Upshift, and other whitespace around Upshift-syntactic characters like ^,
  ?, !, ; is valid, optional, and ignored. Whitespace outside of an Upshift
  expression or inside of a quote/upquote is always taken literally.

- The final closing marker in most Upshift escapes and literals may be omitted
  at the end of the file. See projects/example/src/index.html.up for an
  example. This includes (but may not be limited to) the terminating ; of an
  Upshift statement as well as any closing quote or upquote of a literal within
  a statement. Multiple such delimiters may be omitted as long as they all fall
  at the end of the file. The aforementioned example omits both the "^)" at the
  end of the 'body' value, and the ; at the end of the 'page.up' insertion
  which comprises the whole file.

- Names are currently looked up in a rather static way, first as parameters
  passed in from an insertion call, then from the root of src and lib in that
  order, stopping at the first defined value it finds. No name mangling is
  applied, so for example to refer to a template file named
  "lib/site/nav.html.up" the corresponding name would be "site/nav.html.up".

Insertion of vars/params/templates/files:

    ^name;
        - Inserts the value of the symbol "name"

    ^name param val;
        - Inserts the value of the symbol name, passing it a parameter named
          "param" with the value "val"
        - Name, param and value all may be any literal or nested Upshift
          statement, though the param (its name, not its value) might not
          always work as an Upshift statement yet

    ^ ^metaname; param val ;
        - Remember that "^^" represents a single literal "^", so a space is
          required between the two "^"s to start the name of an insertion call
          with another Upshift sequence.

    ^ ^metaname; ;
        - Also remember to close both inner and outer nested escapes with their
          own separate ";"s.

Conditionals:

    ^?name bar;
        - Inserts bar if the symbol "name"'s value is not ''
        - Name is any literal or escape as in insertion (described previously)

    ^?name foo bar;
        - Inserts bar if the symbol "name"'s value is "foo"

    ^?name foo foo ! bar bar ! ^name; ;
        - If name's value is "foo", insert literal "foo"; else if name is bar,
          insert "bar", else insert the value of the "name" symbol

Upshift Literals (inside ^ statements, above):

    Any Upshift escape previously mentioned (insertion or conditional) may
    itself be used as a value within another Upshift sequence. To write an
    explicit literal string within an Upshift sequence, the following forms are
    supported:

    foo
        - Bare unquoted literal, maximal berevity
        - All letters and numbers are allowed as well as . / \ - and _

    'foo' (or "foo")
        - Quoted, allows whitespace and other special characters
        - ^' escapes a quote to insert a "'" in a quoted string
        - ^^ escapes a ^
        - Any other ^ is invalid, and any other ' ends the literal
        - The rules for double quotes ("") are the same as single quotes, they
          don't indicate any special processing or interpolation as in some
          other languages like Perl; use upquotes (below) for that

    ^(foo^)
        - Inserts a subdefinition in the same format as a standalone template
        - We call this "upquoted"
        - Same escaping rules as the mainline/top level of the template

    "key: "^value; (or any other combination)
        - All literal forms and escapes may be joined/concatenated by omitting
          the otherwise-required whitespace in between them
        - We call this a "compound literal"
        - Semantically equivalent to an upquote (above)
