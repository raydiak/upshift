Upshift is an experimental templating system in Perl 6. It may become more in
the future, but for now it is simply a templating system. Some of the goals in
mind surrounding the existing work to varying degrees are:

- Simple syntax; attempt to require as little as possible in the way of
  memorization and comprehension of the semantics of Upshift, Perl, parsers,
  programming in general, etc. Thus it uses a DSL.

- Be able to template Perl, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, JSON, and hopefully,
  generally "whatever", with a minimal amount of escaping required in as many
  cases as possible. Thus the only character which must be escaped is the
  carrot ("^"), which introduces all non-literal constructs.

- Build the next version of my website with it. Thus there are ways to have a
  single file which defines multiple inserts for head, title, body, etc. This
  means many other things as well, but the metavalue is "it will be somewhat
  pre-tested to be sanely productive for some subset of web uses". Note this
  does *not* mean that Upshift is intended for web uses only, or even
  primarily, but it is definitely designed with them in mind.

- Allow large definition libraries while only loading and parsing the parts
  which are used. Also, don't require tedious predeclarations. Thus named
  symbols are loaded lazily and templates are parsed one time only as needed,
  then cached and simply re-paramaterized for each instantiation.



Processing is accomplished by calling the "upshift" script with the path to the
project's root directory. An optional second parameter will override gen/ as
the destination for output.

> upshift example
    # process example/

> upshift example foo
    # process example/ into foo/ instead of example/gen/

Projects are comprised of templates and non-template files separated into
subdirectories according to their role in the project's processing and output.
The final resulting file structure goes in gen/ which will be deleted if it
already exists. Generation is done by copying the contents of inc/ into gen/
and then processing the contents of src/ as template files, loading symbol
names from all directories as needed, and writing each result into gen/ under
the same file name.

gen/    - where the output goes
src/    - where the input comes from; each template processed into gen
inc/    - copied into gen without processing
lib/    - templates available to use by name but not processed into gen
res/    - raw non-template files available by name but not included in gen



The syntax is as follows:

- All text is parsed as plain literal characters until a ^ is encountered.

- ^^ represents a single literal '^' character.

- Within any ^ sequence, even an escaped escape or quote, whitespace is
  optional in most places except between literals. Put another way, places
  where you might, in other languages, be used to putting a comma after a term
  or a required space or punctuation after a keyword, are required whitespace
  in Upshift, and other whitespace around Upshift-syntactic characters like ^,
  ?, !, ; is valid, optional, and ignored. Whitespace outside of an Upshift
  expression or inside of a quote/upquote is always taken literally.

- The final closing marker in most Upshift escapes and literals may be omitted
  at the end of the file. See example/src/index.html for an example. This
  includes (but may not be limited to) the terminating ; of an Upshift
  statement as well as any closing quote or upquote of a literal within a
  statement. Multiple such delimiters may be omitted as long as they all fall
  at the end of the file. The aforementioned example omits both the ^' at the
  end of the 'body' value, and the ; at the end of the 'page' insertion which
  comprises the whole file.

- Names are currently looked up in a rather static way, first as parameters
  passed in from an insertion call, then from the root of src, lib, inc, and
  res in that order, stopping at the first defined value it finds. No name
  mangling is applied, so for example to refer to a template file named
  "lib/site/nav.html" the corresponding name would be "site/nav.html".

Insertion of vars/params/templates/files:

    ^name;
        - Inserts the value of the symbol "name"

    ^name param val;
        - Inserts the value of the symbol name, passing it a parameter named
          "param" with the value "val"
        - Name is a bare unquoted literal only; param and value are any literal
          or a nested Upshift statement, though the param name might not always
          work as an Upshift statement yet

Conditionals:

    ^?name bar;
        - Inserts bar if the symbol "name"'s value is not ''
        - Name must be a bare literal as in insertion (described previously)

    ^?name foo bar;
        - Inserts bar if the symbol "name"'s value is "foo"

    ^?name foo foo ! bar bar ! ^name; ;
        - If name's value is "foo", insert literal "foo"; else if name is bar,
          insert "bar", else insert the value of the "name" symbol

Upshift Literals (inside ^ statements, above):

    foo
        - Bare unquoted literal, only letters, numbers, and underscores allowed
        - Required form in certain places like the name in an insertion call

    'foo' (or "foo")
        - Quoted, allows whitespace and other special characters
        - ^' escapes a quote to insert a "'" in a quoted string
        - ^^ escapes a ^
        - Any other ^ is invalid, and any other ' ends the literal
        - The rules for double quotes ("") are the same as single quotes, they
          don't indicate any special processing or interpolation as in some
          other languages like Perl; use upquotes (below) for that

    ^'foo^' (or ^"foo^")
        - Inserts a subdefinition in the same format as a standalone template
        - We call this "upquoted"
        - Same escaping rules as the mainline/top level of the template
        - As with normal quotes (above), single and double quotes are
          semantically identical



There are no major known bugs at this time, arguably other than a lack of
several desirable features and adequate test coverage and documentation. Issues
