Upshift is an experimental templating system in Perl 6. Some of the goals in
mind surrounding the existing work to varying degrees are:

- Simple syntax; attempt to require as little as possible in the way of
  memorization and comprehension of the semantics of Upshift, Perl, parsers,
  programming in general, etc. Thus it uses a DSL.

- Be able to template Perl, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, JSON, and hopefully,
  generally "whatever", with a minimal amount of escaping required in as many
  cases as possible. Thus the only character which must be escaped is the
  carrot ("^"), which introduces all non-literal constructs.

- Build the next version of my website with it. Thus there are ways to have a
  single file which defines multiple inserts for head, title, body, etc. This
  means many other things as well, but the metavalue is "it will be somewhat
  pre-tested to be sanely productive for some subset of web uses". Note this
  does *not* mean that Upshift is intended for web uses only, or even
  primarily, but it is definitely designed with them in mind.

- Allow large definition libraries while only loading and parsing the parts
  which are used. Also, don't require tedious predeclarations. Thus named
  symbols are loaded lazily and templates are parsed one time only as needed,
  then cached and simply re-paramaterized for each instantiation.
