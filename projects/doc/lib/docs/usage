An Upshift project is a directory, comprised of files separated into
subdirectories according to their role in the project.

gen/    - where the output goes by default
src/    - where the input comes from; each file processed into gen/
lib/    - files available to use by name; not processed into gen/

Processing is accomplished by calling the "upshift" script with the path to the
project's root directory. An optional second parameter specifies the
destination for output, which defaults to the project's gen/ subdirectory.

The output directory's contents WILL BE DELETED, except where a file is newer
than the corresponding source file, is the same size, is not an Upshift
template (which are always rebuilt rather than performing a recursive
dependency timestamp analysis). This timestamp check can be disabled by passing
--force, which will completely remove the output directory before any source
files are processed.

> upshift example
    # process ./example into ./example/gen

> upshift example foo
    # process ./example into ./foo

Generation is done by iterating over the contents of src/ recursively. Files
ending with the .up extension (regardless of upper/lowercase) are processed as
Upshift templates, and the resulting string is written into gen/ under the same
file name without the .up extension. All other files in src/ are copied into
gen/ without alteration of name or contents, and are available to insert by
name in templates, where they are treated as plain UTF-8 text files.

Files in lib/ are available to Upshift templates as either text or templates
based on file extension as in src/ (above), but are not directly included as
files in the output.
