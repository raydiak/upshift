Processing is accomplished by calling the "upshift" script with the path to the
project's root directory. An optional second parameter will override gen/ as
the destination for output.

> upshift example
    # process ./example into ./example/gen

> upshift example foo
    # process ./example into ./foo

An Upshift project is a directory, comprised of files separated into
subdirectories according to their role in the project's processing. The final
resulting file structure goes in gen/ which will be deleted if it already
exists.

Generation is done by iterating over the contents of src/ recursively. Files
ending with the .up extension (regardless of upper/lowercase) are processed as
Upshift templates, and the resulting string is written into gen/ under the same
file name without the .up extension. All other files in src/ are copied without
alteration of name or contents.

Files in lib/ are available to use in Upshift templates by name, and are read
as Upshift templates with the .up extension, otherwise as UTF-8 text files.

gen/    - where the output goes
src/    - where the input comes from; each file processed into gen
lib/    - files available to use by name but not processed into gen
